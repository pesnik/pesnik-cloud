## üöÄ Welcome to pesnik-cloud!

This project is my personal **cloud playground** where I'm building, experimenting with, and learning the intricacies of **open-source cloud infrastructure**. Inspired by hyperscale cloud platforms like Huawei HCS, my goal is to set up and manage various cloud services from the ground up, understanding their "nitty-gritty" details.

This repository will document my journey, configurations, and discoveries as I assemble a functional cloud environment using leading open-source technologies.

## üéØ Project Goals

* **Hands-on Learning:** Deep dive into the deployment and management of core cloud components (compute, storage, networking).
* **Replicate Cloud Services:** Build open-source alternatives for services found in commercial clouds (e.g., object storage like OBS, big data analytics like MRS).
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Explore automation for provisioning and managing the cluster.
* **Homelab Environment:** Create a robust and flexible private cloud for personal projects and experimentation.
* **Knowledge Sharing:** Document the process for my own reference and to potentially help others on a similar journey.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies (Planned/Under Exploration)

The foundation of `pesnik-cloud` will likely involve a combination of these powerful open-source projects:

* **Container Orchestration:**
    * **Kubernetes (K8s):** For deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
* **Distributed Storage:**
    * **Ceph:** A unified distributed storage system providing object, block, and file storage.
    * **MinIO:** High-performance, S3-compatible object storage.
* **Big Data & Analytics:**
    * **Apache Hadoop Ecosystem:** For distributed processing and storage of large datasets.
    * **Apache Spark:** For fast, general-purpose cluster computing.
    * **Apache Kafka:** For building real-time data pipelines.
* **Virtualization (Optional/Complementary):**
    * **OpenStack:** For a more comprehensive IaaS experience with virtual machines.
    * **Proxmox VE:** For host-level virtualization management.
* **Networking:**
    * **Software-Defined Networking (SDN) solutions:** Within Kubernetes/OpenStack.
* **Monitoring & Logging:**
    * **Prometheus & Grafana:** For metrics collection and visualization.
    * **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):** For centralized log management.
* **CI/CD:**
    * Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or Argo CD for automated deployments.

## üìà Current Status & Next Steps

This project is currently in its **initial setup and planning phase**. My immediate focus will be on:

1.  Setting up the core **Kubernetes cluster**.
2.  Integrating a **distributed storage solution** (likely Ceph or MinIO) to provide persistent storage.
3.  Documenting the hardware setup and initial software installations.

Stay tuned for updates as `pesnik-cloud` evolves!
